Github repository of Operational Systems Projects in C.

## Collaboration with ECE-NTUA:
Lab Partner : Zoe Genakos

# Overview
This repository contains the lab projects conducted in relation to the Operational Systems course, using PuTTY. 
The main focus of these projects is to familiarize oneself with Kernel Programming

### Projects Overview:
- Discover managing processes, handling signals, and parallel computation of numerical expressions.
- Explore synchronization techniques, including coordination mechanisms and parallel computation strategies like Mandelbrot set computation using processes and semaphores.
- Gain insights into virtual memory management, system calls, and fundamental operating system mechanisms for effective resource allocation and management.
